# OTP-Generation-application
A robust and fast paced application developed to demonstrate the process of OTP Generation and verification that takes place during signing in into a website via mobile number. This application has been generated using Dash UI framework of Python that is built on Flask,React.js and Plotly.js and the application has inline css incorporated extensively to give the application a well-organized appeal. This is a multipage application that extenstively validates the user input so that no the input entered by user is highly authenticated and error-free. The first page accepts mobile number and country code from the user and after its submission, an OTP is generated and sent to the user accordingly. Another page opens up that faciliates the user to verify/change the contact number if he/she doesn't receive an OTP via SMS or can make a request for getting another OTP generated and sent in case of anomalies. If OTP entered is incorrect, an error message is displayed at the end of the application but if the OTP generated is accurate than the user is directed to the final page of the apllication to start using the website's resources.
