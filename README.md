# OTP-Generation-application
A robust and fast paced application developed to demonstrate the process of OTP Generation and verification that takes place during signing in into a website via mobile number. This application has been generated using Dash UI framework of Python that is built on Flask,React.js and Plotly.js and the application has inline css and javascript snippets incorporated extensively to give the application a well-organized appeal. This is a multipage application that extenstively validates the user input so that the input entered by user is authenticated and error-free to avoid any possible anomalies. The first page accepts mobile number and country code from the user only in common accepted input standards and after its submission (takes place only if mobile number has 10 digits without charaters, alphabets and spaces), another page opens up that prompts the user to enter the OTP received via SMS and also faciliates the him/her to verify/change the contact number if he/she hasn't received an OTP in due time or can make a request for getting another OTP generated and sent in case of anomalies. If OTP entered is incorrect, an error message is displayed at the bottom of the application but if the OTP generated is accurate, then the user is directed to the final page of the apllication to start using the website's resources.
